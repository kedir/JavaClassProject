Checked exceptions
All exceptions other than Runtime Exceptions are known as 
Checked exceptions as the compiler checks them during compilation to see 
whether the programmer has handled them or not. 
If these exceptions are not handled/declared in the program, you will get compilation error. For example, SQLException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException etc.

Unchecked Exceptions
Runtime Exceptions are also known as Unchecked Exceptions. T
These exceptions are not checked at compile-time so compiler does not check whether 
the programmer has handled them or not but itâ€™s the responsibility of the programmer to handle these exceptions and provide a safe exit. 
For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc.
